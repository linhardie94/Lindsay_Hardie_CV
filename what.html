                <p class="pWhat">
                    I love working in startup environments because you al have to solve really big problems, while not always having the specialists to do it. <br><br>
                    As a curious person, I've learnt a lot by putting my hand up and just getting involve. While most of my career has been in customer insights, I've also worked as: <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An inbound sales rep</li>
                        <li>An SDR</li>
                        <li>A brand marketer</li>
                        <li>A research an insights specialist</li>
                        <li>And an executive assistant</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    I've benefited from really steep learning curves in short periods of time to see how lots of different areas work within a startup. That's put me in a position to understand how what I'm doing fits into the greater landscape.

                <p class="pWhat">
                    Most of my career has been in research. I was the Research & Insights specialist in Yoco's brand marketing team. I surveyed and interviewed thousands of merchants to gain insights to help us run marketing campaigns. I also wrote research papers on the state of small business in South Africa. <br><br>
                    At Truevo, I established Customer Insights as a function so that they could listen to their customers for the first time. We used those insights to improve existing products and launch new products and adapt to the customers needs quickly. <br><br>
                    I gravitate towards roles where I get to work with customers, learn more about how they use a product and make it better for them. <br><br>
                    Take a look at the <a href="https://www.yoco.com/za/blog/yoco-pulse/" target="_blank">Yoco Small Business Pulse</a>, which I conceptualized and executed while at Yoco. It was a quarterly whitepaper that tracked the sentiment of small business across South Africa.                 </p>

                <p class="pWhat">
                    My career has been focused on the nuances of how people interact with fintech. How to sell to them, how they interact with products and how to build products that meet their needs. <br><br>
                    Now I'm diving deeper into the tech part of fintech. I want to use my understanding of customers in this industry to build the tools for them myself. <br><br>
                    I'm looking forward to growing further into the tech part of fintech and understanding the industry from a new perspective. <br><br>
