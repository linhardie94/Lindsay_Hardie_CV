                    I support <a href="https://rootplatform.com/" target="_blank">Root's</a> CEO on a day-to-day basis by executing various tasks and functions that promote his ability to effectively lead and grow the organisation, including those of a critical and confidential nature. <br><br>
                    I took this job to learn more about what it takes to run and grow a tech startup. Having helped execute some of Root's high priority projects, I've learnt a lot about what makes a company successful on a macro level and day-to-day.

                    I was key to launching a new product called the Truevo Account. With no existing Customer Insights function in place, I developed and implemented the methodologies and feedback strategies from the ground up. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, I collected feedback to help the team build products to better serve our customers. <br><br>
                    This included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>setting up and running regular NPS and CSAT surveys</li>
                        <li>running product research interviews and surveys</li>
                        <li>running online experiments and A/B tests to validate marketing and websites</li>
                        <li>conducting regular customer interviews</li>
                        <li>collecting and analysing all qual and quant feedback</li>

                <h4 class="dates">June 2018 – April 2020</h4>
                <p class="pWhat">
                    I sat in the Brand Marketing team and conducted quantitative and qualitative research, positioning the company as a thought leader in the small business space in South Africa. I conducted surveys to over 80 000 <a href="https://www.yoco.com/za/" target="_blank">Yoco</a> merchants, analysed the results and delivered feedback in the form of reports, whitepapers, web pages, blog articles and social content. <br><br>
                    I also conducted market research for the company:
                    <ul>
                        <li>providing useful customer insights for Yoco's brand campaigns,</li>
                        <li>creating brand personas,</li>
                        <li>conducting competitor analyses,</li>

                <h4 class="dates">November 2016 – June 2018</h4>
                <p class="pWhat">
                    I played a key role in growing the Yoco merchant base by finding, researching and contacting potential Yoco customers. I'd reach out to business owners via email or cold calls, learn more about their businesses and assess whether Yoco was a good fit for them. If so, I'd book demos for multiple outbound sales reps to help onboard the customer.
